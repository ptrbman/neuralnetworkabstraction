   $ git clone ....

Ensure that Python 3.x is installed and create a virtual environment:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python -m venv nnenv
   $ source nnenv/bin/activate
   (nnenv) $

Then install prerequisites (TensorFlow, Torch, Marabou, ...)

.. code-block:: console

Quick Test
------------
Do to a quick test of the framework, run the supplmented ``quick_test.py``:

.. code-block:: console

   (nnenv) $ python quick_test.py

Note that since initial weights are non-deterministic, the quick test is not
guaranteed to succeed, but can be stuck in a local optimum.

Additional Test
---------------
For more thorough testing, we refer to the README-file in the experiments directory. It is also possible to use the :doc:`api`
